How do I make a calc file?

###############################################

Using ultimo_burrito requires metric
calculation files to be set up in a 
very specific way.

All files need to be written in the following form
(note, any # is comment not something to use)
If stuck, look at calc_SJ.py for advice

File name must be of the form:
"calc_<metricname>.py

IF THE FILE DOES NOT BEGIN WITH "calc_", ultimo_burrito will 
not load the file!

in calc_<metricname>.py you need at least the following
two modules:

def variable_setter(string):
	if string == 'var'
		string = <variable to use>
	if string =='seas'
		string = <season to use>
	if string =='plot_type'
		string = <plot_to_use>
	return string

############################################

This module can be copied verbatim from calc_SJ.py


We also need the metric within a module that looks like

def main(incube,season,ncfile):

#NOTE TO RORY, CAN WE TURN SEASON INTO A CATCH ALL DUMMY?

# PUT ANYTHING THAT YOU USE TO CALCULATE METRIC IN HERE

	iris.save(<metriccube>,ncfile)

if "__name__" == "__main__":
	main(incube,season,ncfile)

#########################################################

So what do the inputs mean?
	incube - this will be the cube sliced in latitude and longitude 
	from the load_file function

	season - Right now this passes through the season for temporal 
	cutting

	ncfile - This is a specific file name that will uniquely identify
	the file for all time based on all the variables passed in 
	from ultimo_burrito and the metric file name
	HENCE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT THE METRIC NAME IS CLEAR
	IN THE FILE NAME
